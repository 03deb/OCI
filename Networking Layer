{ Load Balancer }

A Load Balancer in OCI is a fully managed, highly available network service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple backend resources
-> No single server gets overwhelmed
-> Applications run faster and stay available even if one server fails
Example: Think of it like a traffic cop standing at a fork in the road, directing cars (requests) to less busy streets (servers).

# In Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), the OCI Load Balancer is a fully managed, highly available service that distributes traffic across multiple compute instances (VMs).
It supports:
Layer 4 (TCP) - Network-level traffic
Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) - Application-level traffic

# Types of OCI Load Balancers
-> Public Load Balancer: Exposes applications to the internet; has a public IP address.
-> Private Load Balancer: Used for internal traffic within a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN); has a private IP address.

# Why Do We Use a Load Balancer?
-> High Availability: If one backend server fails, traffic is rerouted to healthy servers.
-> Scalability: Easily handle more traffic by adding more backend servers without changing client configuration.
-> Fault Tolerance: Minimizes application downtime.
-> Security: Hides backend server details (IP, architecture) from clients.
-> Simplified Management: Centralizes traffic management, SSL termination, and routing logic.
-> Efficient Resource Utilization: Distributes workloads evenly among backend resources.

# Real-World Example: Hosting a Website
Scenario: You're building a shopping website like Amazon.
You deploy:
• 3 Compute Instances (VMs) running your website's backend
Problem: If you send all traffic to only one of them, it may slow down or crash.

Solution: Add a Load Balancer
You set up a Public Load Balancer in front of the 3 instances.

      Now:
                      Clients (Internet)
                            |
                      [Public IP: Load Balancer]
                            |
                      --------------------------
                      |           |           |
                      VM1       VM2         VM3


# What Happens if We Use a Load Balancer:
1. A user visits your website.
2. The Load Balancer receives the request.
3. It checks which backend server is healthy and less busy.
4. Forwards the request accordingly.
If one backend goes down, traffic automatically routes to the remaining healthy ones - users won't even notice.

# What Happens If We Don’t Use a Load Balancer?
1. Single Point of Failure: If a backend server fails, users lose access.
2. Maintenance Complexity: Updating or scaling requires manual reconfiguration for clients.
3. No Health Checks: Clients may connect to unhealthy or offline servers.
4. Poor Scalability: Hard to handle spikes in user traffic efficiently.
5. Limited Security: Exposes backend server IPs and structure to the public.

# In summary:
A Load Balancer in OCI is essential for building reliable, scalable, and secure cloud-native applications. It simplifies management, enhances fault tolerance, and hides 
infrastructure details from users, making it a best practice for any multi-instance deployment.

Here's a breakdown of the 7 layers:

1. Physical Layer:
Deals with the physical connection between devices, including the transmission of raw bitstreams over a physical medium (cables, etc.). 

2. Data Link Layer:
Responsible for error-free transfer of data frames between two directly connected nodes, handling access to the physical medium. 

3. Network Layer:
Manages the routing of data packets between different networks, using logical addresses (IP addresses) to find the best path. 

4. Transport Layer:
Provides reliable or unreliable delivery of data segments, managing flow control, error control, and segmentation/desegmentation. 

5. Session Layer:
Establishes, manages, and terminates connections (sessions) between applications. 

6. Presentation Layer:
Handles data representation, including encryption, decryption, compression, and translation of data formats to ensure interoperability between systems. 

7. Application Layer:
The interface between the user and the network, providing services like email, file transfer, and web browsing. 

# Network Layer (Layer 3) :-
The network layer works for the transmission of data from one host to the other located in different networks. It also takes care of packet routing i.e. selection 
of the shortest path to transmit the packet, from the number of routes available.

* Protocols at this Layer:
-> IPv4 / IPv6 (Internet Protocol): Provides logical addressing and routing.
-> ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol): Used for sending error messages and operational information (e.g., ping).
-> IPsec: For secure IP communications.

Example:
Imagine you send an email from your office computer in New York to a colleague in London. The Network Layer on your computer assigns the destination IP address 
(for the London computer) and determines the route—possibly through several routers and networks—until the email reaches its destination.

Real-life analogy:
It’s like addressing a letter with both the sender and receiver’s street addresses and relying on the postal system to determine the best route from your city to 
another country.

# Transport Layer (Layer 4) :-
It is responsible for the end-to-end delivery of the complete message. The transport layer also provides the acknowledgment of the successful data transmission 
and re-transmits the data if an error is found.

* Protocols at this Layer:
-> TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Reliable, connection-oriented protocol (used for web browsing, email, file transfers).
-> UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Unreliable, connectionless protocol (used for real-time applications like video, voice calls, online games).

Example:
When you open a website (like www.example.com), your browser uses TCP to connect to the web server. TCP ensures that all the pieces (segments) of the webpage 
arrive intact and in the right order. If a piece is missing or corrupted, TCP requests it again.

Real-life analogy:
It’s like a phone conversation where both people confirm that they hear each other clearly and ask for repetition if something is missed.

In summary:
The Network Layer finds the best path for data across networks using IP addresses.
The Transport Layer ensures data gets to the right application, reliably and in order, using protocols like TCP and UDP.

{ Network Load Balancer }

-> A Network Load Balancer (NLB) in OCI is a highly performant, low-latency load balancer that Operates at Layer 3/4 (network and transport layers) of the OSI model, 
specifically handling TCP, UDP, and ICMP traffic.
